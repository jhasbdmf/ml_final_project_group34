you can either run one jupyter notebook final_project_group34.ipynb. It contains both MLP and CNN.
Alternatively, you can run numpy_mlp.py and numpy_cnn.py separately. 

In both cases, you need to have the following files in the same directory as the aforementioned notebook
and/or *.py files:

test_cnn_x.npy
test_cnn_y.npy
test_mlp_x.npy
test_mlp_y.npy
train_cnn_x.npy
train_cnn_y.npy
train_mlp_x.npy
train_mlp_y.npy
